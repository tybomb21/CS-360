Coursework for CS-360 SNHU

update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You may include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you may instead write a paragraph or two that weaves together all of your answers.

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app developed is a weight tracking application for Android devices, designed to help users monitor their daily weight and track their progress. The app's primary goals were to provide users with an easy-to-use interface to log their daily weight, view their progress over time, and set weight loss or gain goals. The app was developed to address the user's need for an effective weight tracking tool that can help them achieve their fitness goals.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app includes a home screen that allows the user to login or create an account. The next screen displays a calendar which allows the user to select a date and input their current weight, a graph to track their weight progress over time, and a history screen to review their previous weight entries. Additionally, the app includes features such as setting weight goals, reminders to log weight, and the ability to track weight in different units. The UI designs were developed with a user-centered approach, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use. The app's interface was designed to be visually appealing, with large buttons, clear typography, and a minimalist layout to ensure that users can quickly access the features they need.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The app was developed using Java programming language and Android Studio development environment. The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic into three components: Model, View, and ViewModel. The app's features were implemented using various techniques such as data binding, room database for data persistence, and coroutines for asynchronous programming. The development process also involved frequent code reviews and testing to ensure that the app was functional and bug-free.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
The app was tested using a combination of manual and automated testing. Manual testing involved testing each feature of the app, including logging weight, setting weight goals, and tracking progress. Automated testing involved unit testing, integration testing, and UI testing to ensure that the app was functional across different devices and Android versions. The testing process was important to ensure that the app was functional, user-friendly, and provided a seamless user experience.


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One of the challenges during the development process was designing the weight graph to display the user's weight progress over time. We had to innovate and come up with a visually appealing graph that could display data in a meaningful way. We used a custom library to create a line chart that displayed weight progress over time. Additionally, we added the ability to display a trend line that showed the overall weight loss or gain trajectory. This innovation helped to make the app more engaging and motivating for users to track their weight.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge and skills in data binding and room database for data persistence. I used data binding to simplify the UI development process by removing boilerplate code and creating a more declarative UI. I also used room database to store weight data and ensure that the data was persistent even when the app was closed or restarted. These skills helped to ensure that the app was efficient, reliable, and provided a seamless user experience.
